Frequent itemsets mining 

I perform an empirical analysis on the Runtime of three important Frequent Itemset Mining Algorithms: Apriori, Eclat and FP-Growth

I used the Dataset Generator created by Jeff Heaton to generate a dataset with the desirable characteristics

The Experiments on Densty and Size effects are made on different lenghts of transactions datasets (10.000, 100.000, 1.000.000)
