Frequent itemsets mining 

I perform an empirical analysis on the Runtime of three important Frequent Itemset Mining Algorithms: Apriori, Eclat and FP-Growth

I used the Dataset Generator created by Jeff Heaton to generate datasets with the desirable characteristics

The Experiments on Density and Size of Transactions effects are made on different lenghts of datasets (10.000, 100.000, 1.000.000)
